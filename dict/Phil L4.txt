    A only if B
A conditional is true in an interpretation I iff either its anticedant (the sentence that precedes the arrow) is False in I or it's consequent (after the arrow) is True in I

    If A then B (equivalent to A->B)

    If not B then not A (equivalent to A->B)

True maps to 1 or +, False maps to 0 or -
AND (^) behaves like multiplication of 0 and 1
OR (v) behaves like addition of 0 and 1
XOR (<->) behaves like multiplication of + and -
NOT (-) behaves like multiplication by -

A sentence A implies B iff the conditional A->B is VALID
    every sentence implies itself
    no sentence LETTER implies another sentence LETTER (1->0 is False)
    In every interpretation of A that is true, B is also true.
    Every sentence implies every valid sentence
    Suppose that B is a valid sentence, and A is an sentence
        B is true in all interpretations. (valid)
        There is no interpretation in which A is true and B is false
            So A implies B
            So any sentence implies a valid sentence
    An unsatisfiable sentence implies every sentence
